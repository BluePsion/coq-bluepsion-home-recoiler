&amp;M*A bird made of chrome is here.  In a few places her skin is bare 
&amp;Mand the metal shines, but most of the creature is covered with feathers 
&amp;Mof all colors and sizes.  The bird turns her head and fixes you with 
&amp;Mone brilliant eye.  Opening her beak, the bird speaks. Her voice is
&amp;Msweet but cracked with static.*

&amp;M*The bird's beak shuts and she gulps.  There's a ringing sound as the 
&amp;Martifact travels down its long neck.  A minute goes by and she suddenly
&amp;Mchirps and the room fills with smoke.  As the bird shifts to the side 
&amp;Myou see an oval shaped artifact there in the nest.  The bird rolls her 
&amp;Mnew egg with her beak.*

Good, good. Quite impressive, treasure hunter. Maybe you're fit to poke 
around my workshop here. I've been wanting another apprentice. So 
unfortunate what happened to Skref, what with the disembowelment and all. 
Take a seat, there.

They were all ... what's this? What *is* that? Wait! It's repeating itself.

&amp;w*Argyve mumbles to himself for several minutes.*&amp;y

Apprentice! Come, here! Something very strange has happened. The Conduit is
picking up a signal, some sort of repeating transmission. I cannot decipher
it, however. I lack cryptogull eggs and, well, never you mind! I have a 
great task for you, my apprentice. Do you accept it?

Very well. You must seek out Barathrum the Old. He is the eldest and wisest
tinker alive. He lives with his followers the Barathrumites in the cavern
called Grit Gate to the northeast, amongst the ruins of Qud. He will know 
what to make of the signal.

    <node ID="Canticle2">
      <text>
They are disciples of Barathrum. Mostly they are Urshiib, like their mentor.
Mutant albino cave bears. With quills to boot! A thousand years ago 
Barathrum and his kin crossed the Homs Delta into the heart of Qud. He has 
spent centuries fiddling with the tokens of antiquity in his underground 
workshops. If he cannot decipher the signal, no one can.

Splendid, apprentice, splendid! I've recorded the signal onto this disc.
You'll need to guard it with your life, I'm afraid.

Also, I'll need to rig up a droid scrambler for you. The Barathrumites have
programmed several waydroids to guard the approach to Grit Gate. With the
scrambler, you'll have no need to worry about them. Wait there.

&amp;w*Argyve mumbles to himself for several minutes.*&amp;y

There you go. Now, off with you! May you live long enough to do my bidding.
Away, away!
