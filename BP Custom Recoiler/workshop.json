{"workshopId":728586071,"Title":"Home Recoiler","Description":"*Make sure you approve this mod on the Caves of Qud title screen before trying to use it*\n\nThis mod adds a custom recoiler into the game.  That means the player chooses where it would like to recoil to.\n\nCustom recoilers can only be set once! \n\nTinkering:\nRecoilers are now integrated into the tinkering system!  When you receive the knowledge of how to build a recoiler from the appropriate quest, keep in mind you will have to have the Tinker skill to make it. Until you have the skill, the recipe will be hidden on your tinkering screen.\n\nEtching:\nThis update adds an inventory action that allows you to etch a label onto your recoiler so you can put in a short description of where it leads.\n\nSee the chrome bird in the top left house in Joppa  to start the quest for this new item.\n\nThis is my first mod so please proceed with caution. Constructive feedback appreciated!\t\t","Tags":"Caves of Qud, Custom Recoiler, Quest, Items","Visibility":"0","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
